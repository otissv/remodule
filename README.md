Warning! Do not read this article if you do not like an easier life.  

Stop now if you enjoy any of following:

- Lots of boilerplate
- Doing the same thing in 3 different places
- Creating lots of action creators and reducers
- Splitting state management across multiple files and forgetting what is where
- Missing out a step when setting up state

If on the other hand you want to get on building your app to get to MVP as quickly as possible then please read on.

## What is Remodule
Remodule is Redux, but removes the tedious tasks of organizing, splitting and collating files. Also does away with the need for constants and creating actions and reducers. Remodule is simply a pattern to encapsulate actions and reducers into modules.

Remodule can be installed via npm
